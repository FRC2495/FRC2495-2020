		// The Rio is set to static 10.24.95.2
		// The Limelight is set to 10.24.95.11 but note that pressing the reset button will revert to DHCP.
		// The Raspberry Pi running FRCVision is set to static 10.24.95.12
		//
		// If a device cannot be accessed (e.g. because its address was somehow obtained via DHCP and mDNS is not working),
		// use Angry IP Scanner to find it!
